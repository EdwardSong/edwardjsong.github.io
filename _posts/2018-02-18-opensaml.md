# Single Sign On (SSO) with OpenSAML

## Terminology

<ul>
    <li>Federated login - in which a user's single identity, is trusted across multiple IT systems or even organizations.</li>
    <li>Identity Provider -  Identity Provider provides Web Single Sign-On capabilities, authenticating users and supplying data to services</li>
    <li>Service Provider - in this context, integrates federated login from an identity provider as the point of authentication.</li>
</ul>

## Authentication Flow

There are so many permutations available in SAML, but the gist of it is below.

<ul>
    <li>Service Provider intercepts access to a protected resource or application entry point.</li>
    <li>Service Provider discovers the user’s choice of Identity Provider.</li>
    <li>Service Provider issues a SAML authentication request to the selected Identity Provider.</li>
    <li>Identity Provider authenticates the user against the identity provider organization’s existing authentication store(s);</li>
    <li>Service Provider processes the SAML authentication responses and extracts rich user information.</li>
    <li>Service Provider applies local policies and gather additional data. (if needed)</li>
</ul>
